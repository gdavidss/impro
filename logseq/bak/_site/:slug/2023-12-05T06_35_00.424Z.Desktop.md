- JUST LIKE A TOUCH OF SPICES IN A STEW, HUMOR AND LEVITY ADD UNIQUE FLAVOR TO THE HEARTY MEAL OF LIFE. THESE VITAL INGREDIENTS HAVE THE POWER TO CONVERT THE MUNDANE INTO THE MAGNETIC, PROVIDING UNEXPECTED DETOURS ON THE WELL-TRODDEN ROADS OF PREDICTABILITY.
- BUT, LET'S "UNMASK" THIS WITH A JOKE, SHALL WE?
- WHY DID THE IMPROVISER BREAK UP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND?
- BECAUSE HE SAID, "I NEED [[SPONTANEITY]]", AND SHE SAID, "I'M CONSTANTLY CHANGING", AND HE SAID, "THAT’S NOT YOU, IT’S JUST YOUR [[DOMINANCE AND SUBMISSION]] GIVING ME MIXED SIGNALS!"
  SEE? HEREIN LIES THE MAGIC OF HUMOR AND LEVITY. IT LIGHTENS THE DENSE PROFUNDITY OF CONCEPTS LIKE DOMINANCE, SUBMISSION, AND SPONTANEITY, MAKING THEM ACCESSIBLE, RELATABLE, AND, OF COURSE, UNEXPECTEDLY AMUSING. AND IN THE GRAND PLAY OF LIFE, IT REMINDS US TO NOT ALWAYS TAKE OUR SCRIPTS TOO SERIOUSLY!
