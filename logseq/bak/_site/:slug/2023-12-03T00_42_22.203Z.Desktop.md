- TIPS:
- embrace spontaneity: ALLOW YOURSELF TO RESPOND INTUITIVELY RATHER THAN ANALYTICALLY. OVERTHINKING CAN STIFLE CREATIVITY. INSTEAD, TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS AND LET YOUR CREATIVITY FLOW.
- say 'yes' more: SAY 'YES' TO YOUR INITIAL IDEAS RATHER THAN BLOCKING THEM. ACCEPTANCE CAN OPEN THE DOORS TO A PLETHORA OF POSSIBILITIES, WHEREAS BLOCKING CAN RESTRICT YOUR CREATIVE THOUGHTS.
- REEVALUATE FEAR OF FAILURE: DON'T LET THE FEAR OF FAILURE OR JUDGMENT CLOUD YOUR CREATIVITY. REMEMBER, IN CREATIVITY THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG, JUST DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND EXPLORATIONS.
- EMBRACE ALL OFFERS: IN THE CREATIVE UNIVERSE, EVERYTHING CAN BE USED AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION. EMBRACE THE UNIVERSE'S OFFERINGS AND USE THEM TO FUEL YOUR IMAGINATION.
  PLAY THE GAME OF 'YES, BUT..': THIS GAME ENCOURAGES SPONTANEITY AND ACCEPTANCE, ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN FREEING CREATIVITY. MAINTAIN AN OPEN AND ACCEPTING ATTITUDE TO AMPLIFY YOUR CREATIVE ENERGY.
- USE 'BLIND OFFERS': MAKE AN OFFER WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC INTENTION AND LET YOUR PARTNER BUILD UPON IT. THIS PRACTICE ENCOURAGES SPONTANEOUS CREATION AND STRENGTHENS IMPROVISATION SKILLS.
- ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES LIKE 'PRESENTS' AND 'ITâ€™S TUESDAY': THESE GAMES REVOLVE AROUND ACCEPTANCE AND MAKING ORDINARY SCENES EXTRAORDINARY. THEY AID IN BUILDING COMFORT WITH SPONTANEITY AND EXPERIMENTING WITH IDEAS.
- WRITE SPONTANEOUSLY: LET YOUR WRITING BE DRIVEN BY YOUR IMAGINATION RATHER THAN CONSCIOUS CONTROL. REMEMBER, THE MOST FASCINATING STORIES OFTEN COME FROM THE SPONTANEOUS FLOW OF THOUGHTS.
- PRACTICE VERSE IMPROVISATION: THIS INVOLVES CREATING A NARRATIVE IN VERSES WITHOUT MUCH PRIOR PLANNING. THIS EXERCISE CAN ENHANCE YOUR SPONTANEOUS CREATIVITY AND FREE YOUR IMAGINATIVE SPIRITS.
- REMEMBER, YOUR IMAGINATION REPRESENTS YOUR TRUE SELF: YOU ARE NOT YOUR PERSONALITY, WHICH IS OFTEN SHAPED BY MULTIPLE EXTERNAL FACTORS. YOUR IMAGINATION EMBODIES YOUR AUTHENTIC SELF AND IS THE SOURCE OF BOUNDLESS CREATIVITY.
