- STATUS IS THE FRAMEWORK THAT HOLDS OUR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. IT'S NOT ABOUT WEALTH OR POWER, THOUGH THEY OFTEN ALIGN. IT'S ABOUT [[DOMINANCE AND SUBMISSION]], A DYNAMIC DANCE WE ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY ENGAGE IN, ADJUSTING OUR POSITION IN RELATION TO OTHERS.
- STATUS PLAYS OUT IN EVERY CONVERSATION, EVERY MEETING, EVERY ENCOUNTER. IT'S IN THE WAY YOU TALK, YOUR BODY LANGUAGE, THE TONE OF YOUR VOICE. IT DICTATES WHO INTERRUPTS, WHO GETS THE LAST WORD, HOW SPACE IS OCCUPIED.
  STATUS ISN'T STATIC. IF YOU INTERACT WITH SOMEONE AND HOLD THEIR GAZE, YOU CLAIM A HIGHER STATUS. GLANCE AWAY, RETURN THE LOOK TOO SOON, YOU LOWER YOUR STATUS. AND IT'S SUBTLE, YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN REALIZE YOU'RE DOING IT. BUT IT AFFECTS HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU, HOW YOU PERCEIVE YOURSELF.
- THE THING WITH STATUS IS THAT IT CAN BE WIELDED LIKE A TOOL, A VEIL, A SHIELD. WE ADJUST IT TO SUIT OUR NEEDS, OUR SITUATIONS, TO MAINTAIN BALANCE OR STIR CONFLICT. AND THE MASTERFUL HANDLING OF STATUS IS THE ART OF FINE IMPROVISATION.
- IN THE CONVERSATION OF LIFE, STATUS IS THE INVISIBLE DIALOGUE. IT'S THE TRAGEDY AND THE COMEDY. THE SEE-SAW THAT BALANCES OUR INTERACTIONS, PROPELLING STORIES, BUILDING TENSION, DRIVING CONFLICT.
  WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND STATUS, YOU BRING A NEW LENS TO VIEW THE WORLD. YOU CAN SEE THE HIDDEN EXCHANGES THAT FORM THE UNDERCURRENT OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. YOU REALIZE, THERE'S A STATUS GAME BEING PLAYED, AND YOU'RE ALREADY PART OF IT.
- SO, ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND [[DOMINANCE AND SUBMISSION]], OR RATHER, STATUS, WATCH HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME. OBSERVE THE TRANSACTIONS THAT HAPPEN AROUND YOU, WITHIN YOU. WATCH THE CONSTANT FLOW, SHIFTS, STRUGGLES, TRIUMPHS OF STATUS. REALIZE, IT'S THE INVISIBLE SCRIPT THAT GUIDES OUR INTERACTIONS, SHAPES OUR RELATIONSHIPS, WRITES OUR STORIES. AND LIKE ANY GAME, KNOWING THE RULES, YOU CAN PLAY CONSCIOUSLY. WITH UNDERSTANDING, WITH AWARENESS, WITH FINESSE.
